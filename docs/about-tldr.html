        <p>I grew up in the Bay Area in a family of software engineers. My mom raised me in hopes I would become an engineer like her - but I was always more interested in art, expression, and human nature. I did take a course in Java during one summer (John Hopkins CTY Program), but while I was capable of writing code, I found myself having way more fun drawing the pictures that we used when we made a (very primitive) pong-style game. Inspired by two of my English teachers in freshman and sophomore year of high school, I decided to pursue English in the hopes of becoming a schoolteacher.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>At Purdue University, I declared as an English Education major, which is by all accounts equivalent to a double-major. Finding a passion for linguistics, I took a minor in that and did some research at the Indigenous and Endangered Languages Lab (IELLab) under one of my linguistics professors. During my last semester, in which I was supposed to student teach, I had the sudden clarity that I wasn't happy. I struggled as a classroom teacher because what I valued the most was the one-on-one help that I could give my students. Being a person of small stature, I discovered that trying to gently tell middle school students was not going to work. I felt that I had to resort to being mean to students in order to get any semblance of control - and I hated that. Worse still, I experienced what it was like to be unable to help students who were in need, due to the constraints and duties of a classroom teacher.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Having no direction of what I wanted to do, not to mention going through the darkest part of my depression, I changed my major to English Literature. This meant I had to take another year since I didn't have the proper credits. Up until this point, I hadn't even considered that I could go into tech without becoming a software engineer of some sort. On a whim (and because it looked interesting), I took a course called Games and Worldbuilding. It blew my mind - not only could I create a world through my writing, but it could be something that someone else experiences through a videogame, as well! As my final for the course, I even wrote my own text-based game, exploring the feelings of depression as well as the fast-paced world of technology.</p>
        <p>Spurred on by the excitement of the course, I stumbled upon a UX course: Games and User Experience. I got to study accessibility in videogames!‍ During this course, I actually got to experience what UX was like - we took a board game, made iterations, tested them, made improvements, and presented our work. It was amazing! But by that point, I was in my last semester, and I did not even consider the idea that this was a field that I could get into. I came back to the Bay Area and quickly became a tutor, for both English and math (up to Algebra 2, anyway) as well as helping students prepare for the local high school entrance exams.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Fast forward 3 years to 2021. We're in the middle of a global pandemic, and I realize that I've become stagnant in terms of my career as a tutor. I love my students, and I love being able to help my students improve through the one-on-one mentorship that I have with them, but I am not learning anything new. As someone who believes in always learning and improving my skills, I realized that I'm not moving in the direction I want to be. I wanted to incorporate my lifelong passions of art and tech into my career, as well.</p>
        <p>I considered careers in tech again, especially since my younger brother found his passion in tech just like our parents. A close friend brought up the idea of UX, and how her other friend had done this boot camp with CareerFoundry. By July 2021, I'd signed up for the UX track and was on my way to learning new skills.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>After completing the CareerFoundry course in May 2022, I started looking for jobs. This exacerbated the imposter syndrome in me, as I found more and more evidence that I wasn’t what people were looking for. When my tutoring company started a private high school that summer, they offered me the art teacher position. I negotiated to make sure I could center the curriculum around tangible careers in art, and that UX design could be part of it. While I ended up rewriting the UX unit into a UI unit due to student feedback (it got too complicated too quickly), I inspired my students to love art to the point that all of them are taking art again this year, despite not needing the extra credits.</p>
        <p>At the end of the school year, May 2023, I was burnt out from teaching. I had already previously realized that I didn’t want to be a classroom teacher, and here I was trying it again. I knew I still wanted to pivot to UX. I looked around for any opportunities, and came across BRIDGEGOOD’s UX Design Apprenticeship. I was almost late to apply, but I barely snuck in an application. I was overjoyed when I was accepted, and, despite knowing the sacrifice it meant (no working over the summer, commuting to Oakland every day), I took it.</p>
        <p>To say this experience has changed my life is an understatement. I made a family: I found a community. I made dear friends like Dominique Stewart-Thomas, got a unique experience with working under pressure, and met so many amazing mentors who care so much about the future generations. </p>
        <br/>
        <p>I am so thrilled to be in this industry, and I can’t wait to help not only my future users but continue to encourage future generations of designers as well. I am actively seeking UX Design opportunities, so please feel free to reach out and chat with me!</p>
