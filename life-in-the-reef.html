            <p>With “Life in the Reef”, I explored notan, which is a design concept that explores balance using only two tones (usually black and white). With this piece, I wanted to try using multiple colors in order to see how it changes the feel of the artwork. I also wanted to diversify the way I used notan: my natural style is to create a fish and then use the cut-out to make a second one. However, in this piece, there are a few instances where I used both parts to create only one fish.</p>
            <p>I found the creation of this piece to be really calming yet rigorous with how many small pieces there were. The excessively small pieces I felt were tedious since they would get stuck to the glue, to my finger… Anything except the page. However, I found that after the struggle of getting them onto the page, the piece came out to look nicer because of all of the extra effort I put in.</p>
            <p>I originally was only going to create the coral reef, at the bottom. However, when I completed the reef, I felt that the page was way too bare with how complex the bottom of it was. I did not want to use more red paper, so I opted to explore using other colors in addition and see how that changed the way the piece looks. I feel like it’s quite colorful, as a reef usually is, but still in sections to show the varying types of life forms that flourish in a reef!</p>
            <p>I am hoping that viewers of “Life in the Reef” see it as a balanced artwork. As notan is about balance, I want viewers to associate the balance with a coral reef. The piece discusses harmony and balance; sea life, in its most natural state, is a thriving ecosystem. It has a perfect balance of the harshness of death alongside the beauty of life, and that is something absolutely worth protecting.</p>
